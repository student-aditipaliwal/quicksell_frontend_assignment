When a user clicks the "display" button and selects a grouping option, the Kanban board should dynamically adjust to reflect the user's choice.

The application offers three distinct ways to group the data:

1. **By Status**: Group tickets based on their current status.
2. **By User**: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.
3. **By Priority**: Group tickets based on their priority level.

It is able to sort the displayed tickets in two ways:

1. **Priority**: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority.
2. **Title**: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.

The Kanban board should be responsive and visually appealing, with a design similar to the provided screenshot. 
This is a resposive Kanban Board 

**Here Are  priority levels for the tickets are as follows:**

- Urgent (Priority level 4)
- High (Priority level 3)

- Low (Priority level 1)
- No priority (Priority level 0)

**Priority levels: **
